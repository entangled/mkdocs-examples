# Entangled / MkDocs Showcase
Here you may find several examples of using Entangled and MkDocs together to generate beautiful notes, technical reports or tutorials.

## [L-Systems in Python](l-systems.md)

!!! abstract

    - :snake: Learn about generators in Python: sure you've heard about `yield`, now `yield from` is guaranteed to :exploding_head: blow your mind!

    - :abacus: Learn how to generate fractal trees, they're pretty!

## [The Buddhabrot Fractal in Rust](buddhabrot.md)

!!! abstract

    - :crab: Parallel computing using Rust and Rayon with two different methods: parallel iterators and join.
